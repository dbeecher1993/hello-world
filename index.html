    <p>I'm a college student double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Astrophysics! I created this webpage with GitHub Pages and a minimal amount of html (this is really sort of a "Hello World" file). It's likely that I'm going to use a premade template for this MAT 5010 assignment, but I would like to revisit this and see how intense the process of building a website from scratch would be over winter break.<p>
